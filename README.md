## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Naveen, an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. My interests are currently in scalable systems design to solve everyday problems and augmenting the human condition with the power of computing. 

ðŸ”— I've included a [link](https://nchalla3.github.io/notes/) to a Quartz page where I host my notes on software engineering, productivity, and all things I find interesting
